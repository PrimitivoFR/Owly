# Doggo üê∂

*This tool is tied to this project's context (for now)*

Doggo is an helper for Evans CLI.
It allows you to open an Evans connection to the port of your choice, with an already set header for authorization.


All you need, is the username and the password of the user you want the token from.

Then use doggo like that :

`doggo <username> <password> <port>`

There u (dog)go ! üê∂


## Install

When you are in this directory, just type `go install doggo` and you should be able to use `doggo` from your command line.


## Additional notes

Of course, you need evans to be already installed and set in your PATH :)
