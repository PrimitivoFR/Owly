# Doggo üê∂

*This tool is tied to this project's context (for now)*

Doggo is an helper CLI tool for the Owly project.

## Install

When you are in this directory, just type `go install doggo` and you should be able to use `doggo` from your command line.

## Functionnalities

Type `doggo --help` to see all available commands and functionalities


### `connect`

**Desc:** Opens an Evans session at desired port, using a user's token from provided username and password


So, all you need, is the username and the password of the user you want the token from.

Then :

`doggo connect -U <username> -P <password> -p <port>`


### `run`, `stop`, `restart`

**DISCLAIMER !** To use this, you need to set an env variable "OWLY_PATH" pointing to your project. Be careful to remove the "/" at the end.

**Desc:** Allows to start, stop or restart the whole architecture, or a single service, in the mode specified by the sub-commands :

|Sub-command|Desc|
|-|-|
|`dev`|Dev mode|
|`test`|Test mode|
|`localprod`|LocalProd mode|

These 3 environnements are used and mounted thanks to docker-compose. The compose-files compositions command are located in `.devtools/*.doggo` files.

You can target a specific service with the `-s` flag.

You can also add additional arguments using the `-a` flag.

#### Examples

**Run all in dev mode**

`doggo run dev`

**Run all in test mode, with exit-code-from server**

`doggo run test -a --exit-code-from server`

**Stop everything that you've had previously started in dev mode**

`doggo stop dev`

**Restart a specific service (here server), from an architecture you're running in dev mode**

`doggo restart dev -s server`


### `docker_clean`

**Desc:** Clean volume, container, system cache out of Docker.

Basically does this : `docker system prune -f && docker container prune -f && docker volume prune -f`

## Additional notes

Of course, you need : 
- evans 
- docker
- docker-compose

to be already installed and set in your PATH :)
