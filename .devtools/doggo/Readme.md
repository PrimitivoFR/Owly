# Doggo üê∂

*This tool is tied to this project context (for now)*

Doggo is an helper for Evans CLI.
It allows you to open an Evans collection to the port of your choice, with an already set header for authorization.


All you need, is the username and the password of the user you want the token from.

Then use doggo like that :

`doggo <username> <password> <port>`

There u (dog)go ! üê∂


## Install

When you are in this directory, just type `go install dogo` and you should be able to use `doggo` from your command line.


## Additional notes

Might not work on Windows host yet, I'll push a fix asap.
